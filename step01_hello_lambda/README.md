mkdir step01_hello_lambda

cdk init app --language typescript

Installing Bootstrap Stack

For Lambda functions we will need to do bootstrapping becuase they require assets i.e. handler code that will be bundleded with the CDK library etc. and stored in S3 bootstraped bucket:

cdk bootstrap

npm run watch

Now follow the Hello Lambda Workshop Chapter

Write a Lambada function in lambda/hello.js

Add your lambda construct in lib/step01_hello_lambda-stack.ts

cdk deploy

Now test the function in AWS Lambda Console (make sure you are in the correct region):

https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions

Next step is to add an API Gateway in front of our function.

npm install @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway

cdk deploy

Get the URL from the output and test it using curl or paste the url in browser:

curl https://xxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/

Now lets learn to run and test Lambdas locally

Run lambda function locally
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/sam.html
Note: Note SAM should be installed and Docker running

cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml

Find the logical ID for your Lambda function in template.yaml. It will look like HelloHandler2E4FBA4D, where 2E4FBA4D represents an 8-character unique ID that the AWS CDK generates for all resources. The line right after it should look like:

Type: AWS::Lambda::Function

sam local invoke HelloHandler2E4FBA4D --no-event

cdk destroy

Single Stack Project commands to run locally (SAM and Docker installed and Docker running):

cdk synth --no-staging > template.yaml

sam local start-api

Multi Stack Project commands to run locally (SAM and Docker installed and Docker running):

cdk synth --no-staging

cd cdk.out

sam local start-api -t {stackname}.template.json

# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a blank project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
